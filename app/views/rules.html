    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <p>The game is played in two teams. The goal is for each player to get his or her team to say the word or phrase displayed in the allotted time.</p>
    <p>A clue-giver can make any physical gesture and give almost any verbal clue, but may not say a word that rhymes with any of the words, give the first letter of a word, say the number of syllables, or say part of any word in the clue (e.g., "worry" for "worry wart"). The one exception is after a team has guessed one word in a phrase. In the above example, if the team guessed that the first word was worry, then the clue-giver can now use that word in the clue.</p>
    <p>If a player decides a phrase is too hard, he may skip it, however he must now act out the next two words for his team to guess before handing the device to the other team. This practice continues if he skips more (e.g. two skips means he must act out three words).</p>
    <p>When a team guesses correctly, the other team takes its turn. The clue-giver passes on the device to the next person. Play continues until the timer runs out. The team not holding the device when time runs out scores a point.</p>
    <p>A correct answer will count if it has started before the buzzer but ends after it sounds (buzzer beaters).</p>
    <p>If the buzzer sounds during a pass, neither team scores a point. A pass occurs between the time one team guesses a correct phrase to the time the next team begins giving a clue.</p>
    <p>The first team to score seven points wins.</p>
    <h2>Variations</h2>
    <h3>Family Feud</h3>
    <p>Once the round is over, the team not holding the device has one chance to guess the word or phrase, with team members allowed to confer. A correct answer earns a bonus point, giving that team a total of two points for the round.</p>
    <h3>Weakest Link</h3>
    <p>Players split up into teams of two and arranged themselves in a circle, with teammates facing each other.</p>
    <p>The team that starts the round will pick a category and announce it to the group. Play starts as soon as the timer is started. The player must then get his teammate to correctly say the phrase by following the rules of normal play.</p>
    <p>If a team guesses the phrase correctly, the device is passed to the player to the left as quickly as possible, without restarting the timer, and no point is scored.</p>
    <p>If a team has the device when the buzzer sounds, the round is over and his team scores a point.</p>
    <p>When a team scores a certain amount of points they are eliminated from play and play continues until only one team is left. The amount of points required to eliminate a team from play can vary depending on the size of the group. For instance, larger groups may find that the game moves faster if they play single elimination.</p>
    <h3>Charades</h3>
    <p>This type of play is fairly self-explanatory. Players cannot use any words to describe the phrases and must act out the clues instead. Mental telepathy is allowed!</p>
